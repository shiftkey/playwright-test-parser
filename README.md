# playwright-test-parser

## A simple utility for parsing JSON outputs from Playwright test runs

Got a Playwright test run and want to quickly identify the slowest tests?

```
$ npx @shiftkey/playwright-test-parser slow [file]
```

Want to see more tests than the default (5)?

```
$ npx @shiftkey/playwright-test-parser slow [file] --count [count]
```
